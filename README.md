### EPUB to Bionic Converter

This is a free online tool to convert EPUB files to Bionic format. 

Credits to the original codebase: [adagradschool/bionic](https://github.com/adagradschool/bionic)

I converted it into a web app using Claude 3 Opus and GPT4

As a non-coder, I created this project in response to the monetization of bionic-reading.com, which turned their concept into a paid subscription service.

I'm open-sourcing this project so others can benefit and create similar tools independently.
